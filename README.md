# car-book-manager
The right way to organize treatment-records for you vehicle.

# Dev notes:
- When you set up the project, make sure you add the front domain for cors purposes in the backend.
- Also make sure to add the backend URL to the Allowed JS Origins in Google API Console + the redirect URL, otherwise the app would not be considered trusted.
